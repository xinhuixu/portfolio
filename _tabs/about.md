- My first name is pronounced like `shin-way`. 
    - It means "new wisdom" in Mandarin Chinese.
    - My last name is pronounced like `shoo`.

- I'm based in NYC, where I grew up. I've also lived, studied, and worked in Massachussets, Virginia, Japan, and Malaysia, where I'm lucky to have met many incredible educator-mentors whose teaching continue to shape the way I create.

- I received my B.A. from Wellesley College in 2021.

- In my free time, I enjoy museums, parks, movies, libraries, cooking and baking, boardgames, and making art, which includes super-amateur photography. This is a mutable list...
